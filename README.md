# Be A Barista!

Run your own coffee shop in this VR experience.

Use the coffee machine to brew coffee and serve to customers. After you collect 20 coins (4 customers served), you can buy a second table and a steam wand from the shop. Then, you'll earn $5 for an espresso and $10 for a latte. You'll grab the espresso and place it near the steam wand to make a latte.

You need to use gaze controls (stare at an object for 2 seconds) and a controller to grab the coffee in this game.
